## Firmware Lifecycle

Firmware, like any product, has a lifecycle from inception and prototyping to full force engineering and deployment to production. Each step in the lifecycle has a different focus and will likely impact the security of the firmware and final device in various ways. In addition, many devices are developed by a third party, not in-house. As a result, you have insights and control over fewer steps in the process.
We identified three critical parts of the lifecycle to achieve the best possible outcome for security:
**Development** — specifically the everyday CI-based engineering effort
**(Acceptance)** Testing — especially for firmware delivered by third parties
**Production Release** — security as gatekeeper for production release and signing.
